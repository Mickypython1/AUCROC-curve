# AUCROC-curve
This repository demonstrates how to implement and visualize the AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic) Curve, a key metric for evaluating classification models. The ROC curve illustrates the trade-off between True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) across different thresholds, while the AUC score summarizes the overall performance of the model.

# FEATURES
Implementation of ROC curve from scratch using Python.

Calculation of True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR).

Visualization of ROC curve using Matplotlib.

Computation of AUC score using both manual integration and scikit-learn utilities.

Example with synthetic and real-world datasets.

# Applications
Medical diagnosis (e.g., cancer detection models).

Fraud detection.

Spam filtering.

Any binary classification problem.
